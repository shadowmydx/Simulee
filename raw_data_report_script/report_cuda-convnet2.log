commit comment:   Revert Tencent modifications to img_acts.cu because they performed invalid memory reads.

Bug symptoms: may crash when try to access out bound memory
Bug root cause: forget to make sure the memory bound
Bug type: kernel function execution::program crash::access unauthorized memory

commit comment:   Considerable speedup(VGG model:1.5x, AlexNet:1.1x)
Optimizations focus on the gpu-related features, such as avoiding bank
conflict, employing wider band width of shared memory, and using
vectorized data type, etc..

Bug symptoms: lower time performance
Bug root cause: bank conflict & band width of shared memory
Bug type: kernel function execution::lower time performance::memory access
